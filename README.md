# MG_LC_Parser_reimplment
Reimplementation of the LC-Parser for MGs from "A sound and complete left corner parsing for Minimalist Grammar" by Stanojevic

Execute main.pl and use the  parse(Input,Output) function

Input is a String and Output is the matching derivation tree

Additionally, a latex-file ltree.tex will be created that visualizes the derivation tree

The lexicon that should be used, can be changed in load.pl and the lexicon itself is in the folder "grammar"
